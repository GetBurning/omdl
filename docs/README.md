What is omdl?
-------------

It is an [OpenSCAD] mechanical design library ([omdl]) that aims to offer open-source high-level design primitives with coherent documentation generated by [Doxygen] using [openscad-amu].


Library API
-----------

* [omdl-v0.4](api/html/omdl-v0.4/index.html)

* [Library List](api/html/index.html)


Design example
--------------

* [Portable solar panel tripod mount](examples/solar_mount/index.html):

  Design took approximately 48 hours from concept to documentation and assembly using [omdl] and [openscad-amu]. Fully automated design flow. Change design parameter, type make, print parts (published on [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2051608)).

What is it?
-----------

It is an [OpenSCAD] mechanical design library ([omdl]) that provides
open-source high-level design primitives with coherent documentation
generated by [Doxygen] using [openscad-amu].

[omdl] performs automated primitive [validation], employs a common set
of conventions for specifying [data types], and is divided into
individual components of functionality that may be included as desired.


Using
-----

See the GitHub source [repository] for setup and [installation]
instructions.


Library API

* [Current release] ({{ site.vcurrent_path }}).
* [Release index]


Design example
--------------

* [A Portable solar panel tripod mount](examples/solar_mount/index.html):

  Design took approximately 48 hours from concept to assembly and
  documentation using [omdl] and [openscad-amu]. Demonstrates the fully
  automated design flow. Change any design parameter, type **make
  all**, then print resulting parts. In this design, parts are
  automatically engraved with the version and part identifier using a
  simple database scheme. Design is published on
  [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2051608).


Contributing

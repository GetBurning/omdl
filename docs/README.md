Introduction
------------

[omdl] is an [OpenSCAD] mechanical design library that provides
open-source high-level design primitives with coherent documentation
generated by [Doxygen] using [openscad-amu].

It undergoes automated primitive [validation], employs a common set of
conventions for specifying [data types], and is divided into individual
component modules of functionality, organized into groups, that may be
included as desired.


### [Groups] ###

<table>
  {% tablerow group in site.omdl_groups %}
    <a href="{{ site.api_vcurrent }}/group__{{ group }}.svg">
      <img src="{{ site.api_vcurrent }}/group__{{ group }}.svg"
        alt="{{ group }}" />
    </a>
  {% endtablerow %}
  {% tablerow group in site.omdl_groups %}
    <a href="{{ site.api_vcurrent }}/group__{{ group }}.html">
      {{ group }}
    </a>
  {% endtablerow %}
</table>


Getting Started
---------------


### Setup ###

See the GitHub source [repository] for setup and [installation]
instructions.


### Library API ###

* [Current release] ({{ site.vcurrent }}).
* [Release index]


Example
-------

* [A Portable solar panel tripod mount](examples/solar_mount/index.html):

  Design took approximately 48 hours from concept to assembly and
  documentation using [omdl] and [openscad-amu]. Demonstrates the fully
  automated design flow. Change any design parameter, type **make
  all**, then print resulting parts. In this design, parts are
  automatically engraved with the version and part identifier using a
  simple database scheme. Design is published on
  [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2051608).


Contributing
------------

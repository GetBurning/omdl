What is omdl?
-------------

It is an [OpenSCAD] mechanical design library ([omdl]) that aims to
offer open-source high-level design libraries of primitive functions
and modules with [coherent] documentation generated by [Doxygen].

With [Doxygen], the code documentation is written within the code
itself, and is thus easy to keep current. Moreover, it provides a
standard way to both write and present [OpenSCAD] script documentation,
compilable to multiple common output formats. This is quite useful for
language-based mechanical design. With [omdl], all library primitives
are *parametric* with minimal, mostly zero, global variable
dependencies and all library [API]'s include [Doxygen markups] that
describe its parameters, behavior, and use.

*Revolutionary no... But a big step in the evolution of a standard way
to share documented OpenSCAD scripts!*


Quickstart
----------

The [omdl] consist of a collection of libraries that may be *used*
or *included* as expected.

**Example:**

```
include <shapes2de.scad>;
include <shapes3d.scad>;

$fn = 36;

frame = triangle_vp2vl( [ [30,0], [0,40], [30,40] ] );
core  = 2 * frame / 3;
vrnd  = [1, 2, 4];

cone( h=20, r=10, vr=2 );
st_radial_copy( n=5, angle=true )
  etriangle_vl_c( vs=frame, vc=core, vr=vrnd, h=10 );
```

Using omdl
----------

To use [omdl] the library files must be copied to one of the
[OpenSCAD Library Locations]. This can be done manually, as described
in the [OpenSCAD] documentation, or can be automated using [openscad-amu].

The ladder is recommended and has several advantages. When using
[openscad-amu], the library reference documentation is installed
together with the library source code. This reference documentation
is also added to a browsable data-table of installed libraries, which
facilitates design reference searches. Moreover, with [openscad-amu]
installed, one can rebuild the [omdl] reference manual or develop
documentation for new [OpenSCAD] designs.


#### Automated install ####

More information on installing [openscad-amu] can be found
[published](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1858181) on [Thingiverse]
and in the GitHib [repository](https://github.com/royasutton/openscad-amu)
where the source is maintained.

A build script exists for *Linux* and *Cygwin* (pull requests for
*macos* are welcome). If *wget* is not available, here is a
downloadable link to the [bootstrap script].

    $ mkdir tmp && cd tmp

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/royasutton/openscad-amu/master/share/scripts/bootstrap.{bash.in,conf} .
    $ sed '1d' bootstrap.bash.in > bootstrap.bash
    $ chmod +x bootstrap.bash

    $ ./bootstrap.bash --yes --install

    $ openscad-seam -v -V

If the last step reports the tool build version, then the install most
likely completed successfully and the temporary directory created in
the first step may be removed when desired (the curious may wish to
explore whats there prior).

    $ cd ..
    $ rm -rf tmp

Now the documentation for [omdl] can be compiled and installed with a
single command. First download the source from [Thingiverse] or clone
the source repository and install as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/royasutton/omdl.git
    $ cd omdl

    $ make install

The library and documentation should now have been installed to the
[OpenSCAD] *built-in* library location along with the reference
manual that can be views with a web browser (or PDF file viewer).

Have a look in:
* **Linux:** $HOME/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries
* **Windows:** My Documents\\OpenSCAD\\libraries

Now you may include the desired library primitives in your project as
follows, replacing the version number as needed (multiple version of
a library may coexists):

```
include <omdl-v0.2/shapes2de.scad>;
include <omdl-v0.2/shapes3d.scad>;
...
```
